In recent years, socioeconomic developments and the spending patterns of individuals and populations have expanded the use of credit. Since individuals use credit to 
fulfill various needs, lending has started to produce more revenue for banks and other financial institutions. Credit can boost the economy and solve cash-related issues 
in the markets when used properly. Nevertheless, they inflict damages and disruption to the economy when used carelessly. The root causes of the credit crisis in 2008 are 
still unresolved. On the other side, the unpaid amount of credit worldwide has doubled in accordance with the lending rate of 2008, and more credit decisions are being made 
on an ongoing basis. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a sustainable solution to prudently evaluate the risk associated with the business and consider lending accordingly.
Financial organizations should analyze credit applications based on unbiased methods to prevent economic and social damages and reduce credit risks. Statistical models help in 
this process of evaluating the risk with unbiased techniques which otherwise is subject to sentimental and human errors. For this reason, algorithms integrating various 
criteria and models have been developed to predict risk-based credit scores. Since default risk refers to the risk of loss that stems from credit users’ incapability to meet 
the responsibilities of the previously granted credit, estimating default probability is critical for effective credit risk management. Keeping these factors in mind, we want 
to create a model to assess credit risk of a home loan applicant based on characteristic of the applicant; including past payment behavior and predict the applicant’s likelihood to default.
